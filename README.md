# React, NodeJS CRUD app with JWT refresh tokens for auth.

The purpose of this fullstack application was to explore and experiment with different web frameworks that allow us to create solutions at a much faster pace. 


All of this has been done through a web app called RoomFindr where users can find affordable rooms when traveling. 

## Features

- A from scratch created JWT authentication with refresh tokens.
- Registered users can be a host of a room/house by posting the image, location and price. 
- All uploaded images will be saved on Cloudinary while text inputs on the local machine. 
- CRUD operations on posts
- Modern UI
- Cross platform

#### Future client-side features:

- Registered users will be able to review and comment a post.
- Dark Mode
- Users will have a profile page where they will see their reservations or their properties that are beeing rented.
- ...
#### Future code improvement:
- A better orginanization of files/folders and adding the necessary middelwares 
- Faster loading time of images in the Home section
